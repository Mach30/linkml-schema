  LinkML model for rules

  This module provides flexible ways to encode constraints and inference rules for a model.
  [Rules](Rule.md) can be encoded in different [syntaxes](rule_syntax_options.md).

  Many syntaxes will only be interpretable by certain systems. For example, rules written in SQL will only
  be interpretable when a model is translated to SQL DDL. Rules can also serve as useful documentation.

  The LinkML rule language is preferred as it will be translatable to different systems. See the separate
  docs for this
