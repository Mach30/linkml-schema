False means that only the key or identifier for the slot appears within the domain, referencing a structure that appears elsewhere. range: Boolean inlined_as_list OPT Description: True means that an inlined slot is represented as a list of range instances. False means that an inlined slot is represented as a dictionary, whose key is the slot key or identifier and whose value is the range instance. range: Boolean inverse OPT Description: indicates that any instance of d s r implies that there is also an instance of r s' d range: SlotDefinition is_class_field OPT Description: indicates that any instance, i, the domain of this slot will include an assert of i s range range: Boolean is_usage_slot OPT Description: True means that this slot was defined in a slot_usage situation range: Boolean key OPT Description: True means that the key slot(s) uniquely identify the container. In future releases, it will be possible for there to be compound keys, where several slots combine to produce a unique identifier range: Boolean maximum_value OPT Description: for slots with ranges of type number, the value must be equal to or lowe than this range: Integer minimum_value OPT Description: for slots with ranges of type number, the value must be equal to or higher than this range: Integer multivalued OPT Description: true means that slot can have more than one value range: Boolean owner OPT Description: the \"owner\" of the slot. It is the class if it appears in the slots list, otherwise the declaring slot range: Definition pattern OPT Description: the string value of the slot must conform to this regular expression range: String range OPT Description: defines the type of the object of the slot. Given the following slot definition S1: domain: C1 range: C2 the declaration X: S1: Y implicitly asserts Y is an instance of C2 * range: [Element](Element.md) readonly OPT Description: If present, slot is read only.

The syntax follows python formatted strings, with slot names enclosed in {}s. These are expanded using the values of those slots. We call the slot with the serialization the s-slot, the slots used in the {}s are v-slots. If both s-slots and v-slots are populated on an object then the value of the s-slot should correspond to the expansion. Implementations of frameworks may choose to use this property to either (a) PARSE: implement automated normalizations by parsing denormalized strings into complex objects (b) GENERARE: implement automated to_string labeling of complex objects For example, a Measurement class may have 3 fields: unit, value, and string_value. The string_value slot may have a string_serialization of {value}{unit} such that if unit=cm and value=2, the value of string_value shouldd be 2cm range: String subproperty_of OPT Description: Ontology property which this slot is a subproperty of range: SlotDefinition symmetric OPT Description: True means that any instance of d s r implies that there is also an instance of r s d range: Boolean usage_slot_name OPT Description: The name of the slot referenced in the slot_usage range: String","title":"Own"},{"location":"SlotDefinition/#inherited-from-definition","text":"abstract OPT Description: an abstract class is a high level class or slot that is typically used to group common slots together and cannot be directly instantiated. range: Boolean aliases 0..* range: String alt_descriptions 0..* range: AltDescription broad mappings 0..* Description: A list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have broader meaning. range: Uriorcurie close mappings 0..* Description: A list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have close meaning. range: Uriorcurie comments 0..* Description: notes and comments about an element intended for external consumption range: String in subsets: (owl) created_by OPT Description: agent that created the element range: Uriorcurie created_on OPT Description: time at which the element was created range: Datetime definition_uri OPT Description: the \"native\" URI of the element range: Uriorcurie deprecated OPT Description: Description of why and when this element will no longer be used range: String deprecated element has exact replacement OPT Description: When an element is deprecated, it can be automatically replaced by this uri or curie range: Uriorcurie deprecated element has possible replacement OPT Description: When an element is deprecated, it can be potentially replaced by this uri or curie range: Uriorcurie description OPT Description: a description of the element's purpose and use range: String in subsets: (owl) exact mappings 0..* Description: A list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have identical meaning. range: Uriorcurie examples 0..* Description: example usages of an element range: Example in subsets: (owl) from_schema OPT Description: id of the schema that defined the element range: Uri id_prefixes 0..* Description: the identifier of this class or slot must begin with one of the URIs referenced by this prefix range: Ncname imported_from OPT Description: the imports entry that this element was derived from.
