As an example, if an image of a wine ontology was loaded from a resource that was in Manchester Syntax, it should be given a different URI than the image loaded from the RDF/XML syntax. The reasoning behind this is, even in cases where different syntaxes are 100% compatible the transformation into the TCCM model may not be identical. \u279eofficialActivationDate - The date that this version of the resource is stated by its publishers to go into effect. \u279eofficialReleaseDate - The date that this version of the resource officially became available. \u279eofficialResourceVersionID - An official label or identifier that was assigned to this version by its publisher \u279epredecessor - A reference to the name and URI version of the resource from which this current version is derived - the \u279esourceAndNotation - A description of where the (or a) source of the version may be found, what format and language it is reversed - true if the slot is to be inversed role - the role played by the slot range rules - the collection of rules that apply to all members of this class class_definition\u279erules see_also - a reference setting_key - the variable name for a setting setting_value - The value assigned for a setting settings - A collection of global variable settings shared - If True, then the relationship between the slot domain and range is many to one or many to many singular_name - a name that is used in the singular form slot_conditions - the redefinition of a slot in the context of the containing class definition. schema_definition\u279eslots - slot definitions slot_group - allows for grouping of related slots into a grouping slot that serves the role of a group slot_names_unique - if true then induced/mangled slot names are not created for class_usage and attributes slot_uri - predicate of this slot for semantic web application slot_usage - the redefinition of a slot in the context of the containing class definition. slots - list of slot names that are applicable to a class source - A related resource from which the element is derived. \u279esourceAndNotationDescription - A textual description of where the specified resource version was derived from.

This URI needs to be constructed in such a way that, if necessary, it will be possible to differentiate resource versions that were loaded from different document syntaxes. As an example, if an image of a wine ontology was loaded from a resource that was in Manchester Syntax, it should be given a different URI than the image loaded from the RDF/XML syntax. The reasoning behind this is, even in cases where different syntaxes are 100% compatible the transformation into the TCCM model may not be identical. \u279eofficialActivationDate - The date that this version of the resource is stated by its publishers to go into effect. \u279eofficialReleaseDate - The date that this version of the resource officially became available. \u279eofficialResourceVersionID - An official label or identifier that was assigned to this version by its publisher \u279epredecessor - A reference to the name and URI version of the resource from which this current version is derived - the \u279esourceAndNotation - A description of where the (or a) source of the version may be found, what format and language it is reversed - true if the slot is to be inversed role - the role played by the slot range rules - the collection of rules that apply to all members of this class class_definition\u279erules see_also - a reference setting_key - the variable name for a setting setting_value - The value assigned for a setting settings - A collection of global variable settings shared - If True, then the relationship between the slot domain and range is many to one or many to many singular_name - a name that is used in the singular form slot_conditions - the redefinition of a slot in the context of the containing class definition. schema_definition\u279eslots - slot definitions slot_group - allows for grouping of related slots into a grouping slot that serves the role of a group slot_names_unique - if true then induced/mangled slot names are not created for class_usage and attributes slot_uri - predicate of this slot for semantic web application slot_usage - the redefinition of a slot in the context of the containing class definition. slots - list of slot names that are applicable to a class source - A related resource from which the element is derived. \u279esourceAndNotationDescription - A textual description of where the specified resource version was derived from.

We call the slot with the serialization the s-slot, the slots used in the {}s are v-slots. If both s-slots and v-slots are populated on an object then the value of the s-slot should correspond to the expansion. Implementations of frameworks may choose to use this property to either (a) PARSE: implement automated normalizations by parsing denormalized strings into complex objects (b) GENERARE: implement automated to_string labeling of complex objects For example, a Measurement class may have 3 fields: unit, value, and string_value.

While multiple inheritance is not allowed, mixins can be provided effectively providing the same thing. The semantics are the same when translated to formalisms that allow MI (e.g. RDFS/OWL). When translating to a SI framework (e.g. java classes, python classes) then is a is used. When translating a framework without polymorphism (e.g. json-schema, solr document schema) then is a and mixins are recursively unfolded Range: Definition in subsets: (basic,object_oriented) abstract 0..1 Description: an abstract class is a high level class or slot that is typically used to group common slots together and cannot be directly instantiated.

For example, if we have a core schema where a gene has two slots for identifier and symbol, and we have a specialized schema for my_organism where we wish to add a slot systematic_name, we can avoid subclassing by defining a class gene_my_organism, adding the slot to this class, and then adding an apply_to pointing to the gene class.

The syntax follows python formatted strings, with slot names enclosed in {}s. These are expanded using the values of those slots. We call the slot with the serialization the s-slot, the slots used in the {}s are v-slots. If both s-slots and v-slots are populated on an object then the value of the s-slot should correspond to the expansion. Implementations of frameworks may choose to use this property to either (a) PARSE: implement automated normalizations by parsing denormalized strings into complex objects (b) GENERARE: implement automated to_string labeling of complex objects For example, a Measurement class may have 3 fields: unit, value, and string_value. The string_value slot may have a string_serialization of {value}{unit} such that if unit=cm and value=2, the value of string_value shouldd be 2cm Range: String","title":"Own"},{"location":"Definition/#inherited-from-element","text":"name 1..1 Description: the unique name of the element within the context of the schema.
