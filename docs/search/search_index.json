For example, if we have a core schema where a gene has two slots for identifier and symbol, and we have a specialized schema for my_organism where we wish to add a slot systematic_name, we can avoid subclassing by defining a class gene_my_organism, adding the slot to this class, and then adding an apply_to pointing to the gene class.

The syntax follows python formatted strings, with slot names enclosed in {}s. These are expanded using the values of those slots. We call the slot with the serialization the s-slot, the slots used in the {}s are v-slots. If both s-slots and v-slots are populated on an object then the value of the s-slot should correspond to the expansion. Implementations of frameworks may choose to use this property to either (a) PARSE: implement automated normalizations by parsing denormalized strings into complex objects (b) GENERARE: implement automated to_string labeling of complex objects For example, a Measurement class may have 3 fields: unit, value, and string_value.
